Script Requirements:
- As a user, I want to get the current timestamp in 'yymmddHHMMSS' format.
- As a user, I want to construct a file path for a new note in the '~/code/notes/df' directory.
- As a user, I want to create this new note file with '# ' as its initial content.
- As a user, I want to execute a command to open this new file with the 'code' executable located at '$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/code'.
- As a user, I want the script to run silently, printing no output on success but reporting errors to stderr.
