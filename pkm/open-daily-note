Script Requirements:
- As a user, I want to calculate the current date in 'yymmdd' format.
- As a user, I want to construct a file path for a daily note, formatted as '~/code/notes/dn_DATE.md'.
- As a user, I want to execute a command to open this file with the 'code' executable located at '$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/code'.
- As a user, I want the script to run silently, printing no output on success.
