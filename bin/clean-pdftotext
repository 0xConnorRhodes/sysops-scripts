Script Requirements:
- As a user, I want to read a text file provided as a command-line argument.
- As a user, I want to completely remove any lines that contain only numeric digits (ignoring whitespace).
- As a user, I want to strip the Form Feed control character (^L) from any line where it appears.
- As a user, I want the cleaned text to be printed to standard output or saved to a file if redirected.
